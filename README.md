### Description

VOT-CP is a Python program that allows for the automatic codification of phonetically aligned data in order to obtain VOT predictions. This program makes use of [AutoVOT](https://github.com/mlml/autovot)'s model for generating the VOT calculations. When provided with a TextGrid that contains a word and phone tier, the program will identify all word-initial stop consonants of interest. VOT-CP will then generate and populate a new tier that can be used by AutoVOT to find the burst and onset of voicing for all selected segments. 

The program takes in:

1. a `.wav` file
2. a `.TextGrid` with aligned word and phone tiers

And it returns

1. a new TextGrid file that contains: 
  - the original word and phone tiers,
  - a tier with all the stops of interest, and 
  - a tier with VOT predictions generated by AutoVOT's model.

VOT-CP does not modify the original files in any way. However, users are advised to keep a backup of all files processed with this software.

This program is designed to work with cross-linguistic data, and with data in various formats, for example:
  * multiple speakers in the same recording, 
  * audio files with duplicate or distinct channels, 
  * audio files with various sampling frequencies, 
  * and more.

This is a beta version. Any reports of bugs, suggestions for improvements to the software or the documentation, or questions are welcome and greatly appreciated.
