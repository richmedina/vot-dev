VOT-CP is a Python program that allows for the automatic codification of phonetically aligned data in order to obtain VOT predictions. This program makes use of [AutoVOT](https://github.com/mlml/autovot)'s model for generating the VOT calculations. When provided with a TextGrid that includes a word and phone tier, the program will identify all word-initial stop consonants of interest. The program will then generate and populate a new tier that can be used by AutoVOT to identify the section in the wav file to look for the burst and onset of voicing. The program takes in:

1. a wav file
2. a TextGrid with aligned word and phone tiers

And it returns

1. a new TextGrid tier that contains the original word and phone tiers, as well as a new tier with all the stops of interest and a final tier with VOT predictions generated by AutoVOT's model.

This is a beta version. Any reports of bugs, suggestions for improvements to the software or the documentation, or questions are welcome and greatly appreciated.
